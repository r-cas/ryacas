  Sys.setenv so yacas works with R 2.5.0

Changes in version 0.2-4

  - yacas.exe, scripts.dat no longer included in Ryacas distribution
  - new Windows-only yacasInstall and yacasFile commands
    to facilitate installation of yacas
  - .First.lib reminds Windows users to install yacas if yacas not found

o Ryacas now uses yacas 1.0.63 on all platforms. (The yacas Windows binary

  home page. On Windows yacasInstall() will download it, extract yacas.exe and
  scripts.dat and place them both in ...\Ryacas\yacdir.)

  to yacas as of yacas version 1.0.62)

o runYacas now uses wait = FALSE on Windows

  but also "input" and "output"

o Ryacas-Sym vignette fixed

o most .Sym methods have been made .default methods

o Identity, Identity.default added

o new YACAS_INVOCATION_STRING environment variable can be set to
  override the default yacas invocation string.  (It also overrides
  the settings of the other YACAS_ environment variables which are
  only available on Windows.)  Thanks to Simon Blomberg for 
  discovering certain possible startup problems.  This should provide
  a general "out" for these on systems that need it.

o method = "system" in yacas command now works at least on Windows

o yacas method argument defaults to getOption("yacas.method")
  and to "socket" if that is not set.

Changes in version 0.1-11

o yacas now starts up when the first time the yacas command is given for
  method = "socket" rather than at package startup (or if the user
  explicitly invokes the optional yacasStart() function).

o new yacas method = "system" argument which uses the R "system" command 
  to spawn a new instance of yacas each time yacas is called and so does 
  not require sockets.  The default continues to be method = "socket".

o new command yacasInvokeString which outputs the invocation string for
  yacas (with no trailing &).

o yacasStop has a verbose argument (like yacasStart).

o yacas.character has an addSemi argument that defaults to TRUE.

o WISHLIST updated

o yacas is now a generic with character and expression methods

o added method= argument to yacas (currently unused)

Changes in version 0.1-5

o yacmode function from yacasR added

o yacas.start renamed and yacas.stop renamed to yacasStart and yacasStop.

  is used in the yacas example.

o yacas now has verbose = FALSE by default but returns yac.res

o WISHLIST updated

Changes in version 0.1-4

o taskkill used instead of pskill for Windows.  Now no auxilliary process
  termination utility is used but only XP Pro will get its yacas process 
  terminated on exit.

o windows now kills process using pskill.exe which is included

o yacas binary 1.0.57 for Windows now included
